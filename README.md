## Pokedex AI
<pre>
A quick fun site that I made (MY SECOND SITE)
Don't judge it too much, I work with "first mobile, then desktop" approach.
I want to implement AI to it later, that will give strategies or fun facts about pokemons
For now, it has just a quick usage of API along with story generation that isn't used, cause I needed to learn how to use AI
